# Project_Toolkit

## Project purpose:
This semester, in Systems Biology class we have learned about using differential equations to model behavior of biological systems. We have found this method especially interesting. Modeling can help us better understand human physiology and how different diseases can come about. For our project, we decided to closely examine three different models of glucose-insulin dynamics, hoping to see their limits and differing applicability.

## Project guide
In the project we have 3 folders: 
- Folder Models contains .r and .qmd codes with Insulin/Glucose models we've made. 
- Folder images contain mainly plots we used in our application. 
- Folder Final Project contains application in shiny and raport in pdf made in Latex

## Contribution to project:
- Zofia Sikorska: made github repository, made Minmal Model, made Parameter Disturbtion in Minimal Model in Shiny, added plots to raport, added section 3.1 in raport, reorginzed folders
