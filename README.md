# Project_Toolkit

## Project Purpose:
This semester, in our Systems Biology class, we have learned about using differential equations to model the behavior of biological systems. We found this method particularly interesting. Modeling can help us better understand human physiology and how various diseases can develop. For our project, we decided to closely examine three different models of glucose-insulin dynamics, aiming to explore their limitations and differing applicability.

## Project Guide:
The project consists of three folders:
- The Models folder contains .r and .qmd code files with the insulin/glucose models we created.
- The Images folder mainly contains plots used in our application.
- The Final Project folder includes the Shiny application and the report in PDF format, created using LaTeX.

## Contribution to the Project:
- Zofia Sikorska: Created the GitHub repository, developed the Minimal Model, implemented Parameter Disturbance in the Minimal Model in Shiny, added plots to the report, wrote Section 3.1 of the report, and reorganized the folder structure, wrote README.md file.
- Kinga Kurowska: developed the Dynamical Model, implemented comparison of Dynamical and Minimal Model in Shiny, implemented time delay dependent oscillations in Dynamical Model in Shiny
- Wiktor Rorat: Provided references, wrote most of the LateX file, helped with making graphs, tried and failed to implement BIG model, found model-breaking conditions
